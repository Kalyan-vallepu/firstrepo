1. Write a python program sort the list without using sort() method
Sample Input:
list1 = [3,6,2,4,8,7,22,11,13,9,0,1,0]
Expected Output:
[0,0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,13,22........]

2. Write a python program print the tables. Follow the steps
Step 1:
Teke two user input
start = userinput()
end = userinput()
Step 2:
print the tables for example start =1, end = 10
print 1 to 10 tables
Expected Output:
1*1=1
1*2=2
-----
-----
1*10=10

2*1=2
2*2=4
-----
-----

3. Write a python program to print the pattern using nested for loop
Expected Output:
    *
   * *
  * * *
 * * * * 
* * * * *

4. Write a python program follow the below steps
Step1:
Take user input that is words of string like "python is easy to understand"
Step2:
Split the string without using split() menthd
Step3:
print the each word with other words
Expected Output:
first one
["python","is","easy","understand"]
final output is:
python is      
python easy
python undestand
is python
is easy
is understand
----------
----------

5. Write a python program compare two lists words, if both words are same print that word

= ["Ravi","Anil","Madhu","Mahesh","Manohar"]
list2 = ["Madhu","Karthik","Ravi","Sravn"]
Expected Output:
Madhu
Ravi

6. Write a python program to take the tuple of list with elements
Sample Input:
tuple_of_list = (1,2,3,4,[],5,6,7,8) --> I want to add elements in list, But I want to add only inside tuple of elemnts
Expected Output:
(1,2,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],5,6,7,8)

7. Write a python take two nested list, compare outside list and nested list, if outside list and inside list
   elements are same delete the outside list element, don't use another list.
Sample Input:
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9[10,20,30,4,1,3,5,7],100,200,300,400]
Expcted Output:
[2,6,8,9[10,20,30,4,1,3,5,7],100,200,300,400] 

8. Write a python program take the nested dictionary, if valurs are list print the even numbers in that list
Sample Input:
nested_dict = {"name":{"list1":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],"list2":["karthik",10,21,25,27,40,44,46,"ravi"},"name2":{"first":(1,2,3,4,5),"second":[90,98,99,76,77,55,48]}}
